An HTTP client program that queries Microsoft’s Bing search engine for a search term.

# MiniProject2
A program that discovers and lists all computers that are online (i.e., up running) in a given IP address range.

# MiniProject3
An concurrent HTTP server. It is able to interact with a full-fledged browser, e.g. Firefox. The server serves clients using the standard port 80. The server serves only two types of files: html and jpg. The server is concurrent along two axes: It can serve multiple clients concurrently, and it can serve multiple parallel connections from each client concurrently.

# MiniProject4
A UDP-based client-server ping application using socket API. 

# MiniProject5
An Web proxy works as follows:
1. It accepts a TCP connection from the browser.
2. It accepts a HTTP request from the browser for some content hosted by some Web server.
3. It performs a DNS lookup of the Web server.
4. It establishes a TCP connection to the Web server.
5. It sends the client’s HTTP request to the Web server.
6. It forwards the response it receives from the Web server to the browser.
